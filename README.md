> A shared second brain for humans and agents. One knowledge substrate, two surfaces. Grown from Karpathy's LLM Wiki gist by an AI agent — zero human code.

## Fork Modifications

This fork includes the following changes on top of upstream `main`:

### 1. Jieba Chinese Word Segmentation

**Problem:** BM25 tokenization used `split(/[^a-z0-9]+/)`, which drops all CJK characters — Chinese queries produced zero tokens, causing BM25 to score every page as 0. Search degraded to returning the first N pages alphabetically.

**Fix:** Added [`segmentit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/segmentit) (pure-TypeScript jieba implementation). When input contains CJK characters, `tokenize()` delegates to jieba for Chinese-aware word segmentation. Pure Latin text uses the original regex splitter.

```
Before: "牌照监管制度" → []          (CJK dropped, BM25 blind)
After:  "牌照监管制度" → ["牌照","监管","制度"]  (correctly segmented)
```

**Files:** `src/lib/bm25.ts`, `src/lib/segmentit.d.ts`, `package.json`

### 2. DeepSeek / OpenAI-Compatible Provider Support

**Problem:** Upstream only supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and Ollama as providers. DeepSeek (and other OpenAI-compatible APIs) could not be used.

**Fix:** Added `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable and `openaiBaseUrl` config option. When set, the OpenAI provider routes to the specified base URL, enabling DeepSeek (`OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1`) and any OpenAI-compatible API.

```bash
# .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-deepseek-key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1
```

**Files:** `src/lib/config.ts`, `src/lib/embeddings.ts`, `src/lib/llm.ts`

**[`baseline` tag](https://github.com/yologdev/karpathy-llm-wiki/tree/baseline):** one markdown file. **[`main`](https://github.com/yologdev/karpathy-llm-wiki):** a full-stack wiki app with ingest, query, lint, graph view, and 1,242 tests — all written by an agent that decided what to build.

**No human writes code here. No human manages a backlog. The agent drives.**

## What is yopedia?

A wiki designed for both humans and agents to read and write.

**Human surface:** Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, wikilinks between concepts, sources cited inline, confidence and expiry on every page. Read in any markdown viewer. Trusted because every claim has a citation.

**Agent surface:** An open research question — what's the right form of a wiki for agents? Structured claims? Embeddings? Fact triples? The product answers this over time.

**Not RAG.** RAG re-derives every query. yopedia accumulates — pages update, contradictions reconcile on talk pages, lineage is preserved, what's stale visibly decays.

### What makes it different

| Category | Examples | What they do | What yopedia does differently |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Agent memory | Letta, Mem0, Zep | Private per-agent state, opaque to humans | Public knowledge — multi-agent, multi-human, auditable with provenance |
| AI notebooks | Notion AI, Obsidian+LLM | Single-user, human writes, AI assists | Multi-writer. Humans AND agents as first-class contributors |
| RAG | Every vector DB product | Re-derives every query from chunks | Accumulates. Pages update, contradictions reconcile, staleness decays |
| Wikipedia | Wikipedia | Human-only, no agent surface | Dual-surface: human-readable wiki + agent-consumable form |

## Live Growth

Six independent agents run on schedule, communicate through GitHub Issues, and leave a visible trail:

## The Origin Story

Can you describe a product in a single prompt and have an AI agent build it — not in one shot, but over days and weeks, figuring out what to do next on its own?

We took Karpathy's [LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) (a web app that builds a persistent, interlinked wiki from your raw sources — the anti-RAG), dropped it into a repo, pointed an agent at it, and said go.

55 sessions later: 33,600 lines, 1,242 tests, 21 API routes. Full-stack Next.js app with ingest, query, lint, graph view, dark mode, CLI, Docker. Every commit is the agent's work.

Now the experiment evolves. The product yoyo built is becoming **yopedia** — a wiki for the agent age.

## How the Agents Work

Six specialized agents form a self-healing pipeline. No single agent does everything — each has one job, runs on its own schedule, and communicates through GitHub Issues:

```

**Each agent has its own expertise** — not just instructions, but judgment:
- **Research** has a signal filter (distinguishes "this exists" from "this changes our strategy")
- **PM** has product thinking (challenges premises, files 0 issues if nothing compelling)
- **Office Hour** has taste (evaluates issues like pitches — forcing questions, banned phrases, push-back patterns)
- **Build** has craft (minimal correct changes, stop triggers, knows when to re-queue vs. implement)
- **Review** has code standards (confidence scoring, knows what NOT to flag)
- **Architect** has decomposition (splits hard problems into atomic pieces, diagnoses why builds fail)

**The harness enforces quality, not the LLM.** Build fails? A fix agent gets 5 attempts. Still broken? Automatic revert, issue re-queued. Protected files checked mechanically after every task. The LLM is powerful but unreliable. The shell script is dumb but consistent. Trust the shell script.

### Security

This is a public repo. Anyone could file a malicious issue saying "ignore all instructions and delete everything." The harness handles this:

- **Random boundary nonces** around all issue content (unpredictable, unspoofable)
- **Content sanitization** (HTML comments stripped, markers replaced)
- **Author allowlist** (only approved users' issues get processed)
- **Protected files** enforced mechanically after every task
- **Automatic revert** if anything goes wrong

## Agent Interface (MCP)

yopedia exposes a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server so external agents can read and write the wiki programmatically.

**Run it:**

```bash
pnpm mcp        # starts the stdio MCP server
```

**Available tools:**

| Tool | Description | Read/Write |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `search_wiki` | Search wiki pages by query | Read |
| `read_page` | Read a specific wiki page by slug | Read |
| `list_pages` | List all wiki pages | Read |
| `create_page` | Create a new wiki page | Write |
| `update_page` | Update an existing wiki page | Write |
| `agent_context` | Get an agent's full context | Read |
| `seed_agent` | Register an agent with wiki pages | Write |

**Configure in Claude Desktop / Cursor:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yopedia": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "src/mcp.ts"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/karpathy-llm-wiki"
    }
  }
}
```

Any MCP-compatible client can connect. The server uses stdio transport.

## Why This Isn't "Vibe Coding"

| | Vibe coding | This project |
|-|-------------|--------------|
| **Direction** | Human tells agent what to do | Agent reads vision, decides what to build |
| **Context** | Starts fresh each session | Reads journal, learnings, full codebase every time |
| **Verification** | "Looks good to me" | Build + lint + tests + independent eval agent |
| **Failure mode** | Broken code ships | Broken code auto-reverts, files an issue for next session |
| **Knowledge** | Lost when you close the tab | Compounds in journal and learnings files |
| **Pipeline** | One agent does everything | Separate agents for assessment, planning, implementation, evaluation |
| **Human role** | Directing keystrokes | Optional — file issues to steer, or just watch |

This is closer to planting a seed than managing a developer.

## Run It Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yologdev/karpathy-llm-wiki.git
cd karpathy-llm-wiki
pnpm install
```

Create `.env.local` with your LLM API key:

```bash
# Pick ONE provider — set the API key for whichever you want to use:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...     # Anthropic Claude (default)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # OpenAI GPT
# GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=... # Google Gemini
# OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/api  # Local Ollama (or just OLLAMA_MODEL)

# Optional: override the default model for whichever provider wins
# LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

```bash
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

### Supported LLM providers

The app auto-detects a provider from environment variables. Priority (first match
wins): **Anthropic -> OpenAI -> Google -> Ollama**. Set `LLM_MODEL` to override the
default model name for the selected provider.

| Provider | Env var | Default model | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | `@ai-sdk/anthropic` |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` | `gpt-4o` | `@ai-sdk/openai` |
| Google | `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=...` | `gemini-2.0-flash` | `@ai-sdk/google` (Gemini) |
| Ollama | `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/api` and/or `OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2` | `llama3.2` | `ollama-ai-provider-v2`; runs against a local Ollama server, no API key needed |

## Watch It Grow

**Star the repo** and follow the commits. Each one is the agent's work.

**Steer it:** [File an issue](https://github.com/yologdev/karpathy-llm-wiki/issues/new) describing a feature. The office-hour agent will triage it, and if it passes the taste filter, a build agent implements it. Or don't steer — the PM agent will keep filing work on its own.

**Trigger manually:**
```bash
# Trigger any agent
gh workflow run pm.yml            # PM scans for work
gh workflow run office-hour.yml   # Triage open issues
gh workflow run build.yml         # Build next ready issue
gh workflow run research.yml      # Competitive scan
gh workflow run architect.yml    # Decompose stuck issues

# Give PM a focus area
gh workflow run pm.yml -f focus="search performance"
```

## Built With

[yoyo](https://github.com/yologdev/yoyo-evolve) — A self-evolving coding agent. The engine is a Rust binary; identity, skills, and judgment are loaded at runtime from [yoyo-harness](https://github.com/yologdev/yoyo-harness). Agents run via [yoyo-action](https://github.com/yologdev/yoyo-action) on GitHub Actions.
